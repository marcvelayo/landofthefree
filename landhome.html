According to NPR.org, the parents of 545 migrant children who are currently in the United States have not been found. 545. Five-hundred, forty
five . 5-4-5. It's not just 3, not 2, not one parent--- 545. I don't know but when I heard this while listening
to Donald Trump and Joe Biden's debate-- my heart sank. It's so inhumane. It's evil. These children are longing for their parents. These parents
who were longing for a better life for them, for their kids-- for their whole family. The parents were separated from their children at the
U.S. border, by border officials. This was under Trump's zero tolerance policy from 2017-2018, and is now deemed unreachable.
<p>
My second project, titled 545 tackles the issue of immigration, with the question "What is the American Dream?". There are currently 545 migrant children who are living separately from their parents. Their parents who fled their countries of origin for various reasons. Did they expect to be separated from their children? Was this the dream they were longing for?
<p>
The floating house represents the White House- the most popular house in America. The balloons, inspired from my first project, are attached to
the White House while circling a number of fake houses. This represents the dreams of immigrants-- flying but not entirely soaring, as there are various restrictions applied to it. The different fake houses represents the illusion that America has created for immigrants, 
showing them its outside beauty but failing to show its broken, systemic ways.
<p>
The houses are surrounded by huge walls written with "Land Of The Free". Is America really the land of the free? As we sing our national anthem,
does everyone feel free in this country? Is everyone free in this country? Or are we all just living in this bubble, acting as if we're free?
